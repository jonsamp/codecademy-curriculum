we can use typescript to declare types on many things. as it turns out, javascript programs will often run, even when there are type errors. in the following project, let's go through and fix up this program to have proper types, and in the process we will have a program that works. also this is a great way to make code last longer/more sustainable, since it's easier to add/change/etc.
