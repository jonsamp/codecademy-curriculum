## TypeScript

View the TypeScript course [here](https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/8919c6e406a278d1f46ec39893a65655/exercises/from-javascript-to-typescript).

Currently there are two projects in development. The first is a pre-written program with many type errors, where the learner will debug and correct the program. The second will be a either fully written or possibly partially written project, where the learner will write types as they code something new.

Navigate to project-1 and project-2 directories to learn more.
