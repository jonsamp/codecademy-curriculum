## Overview

This project is still a work in progress.

It will be either a partially written program, where the learner must add on a feature (with types), or a project where they code something on their own with types.

Some ideas:

1. Some kind of game or quiz. This could allow learners to validate input and get some output based on those typed inputs.
2. Running goal calculator program.
3. Book finder program. Write a program to search a list of books.
4. Finish writing logic to find a learner's streak. Could be interesting to have the learner code something that they've used before on Codecademy.
